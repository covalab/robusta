# Introduction

Robusta is a framework where it can:

- Run and extend your awesome **Dart/Flutter** apps.
- Control services dependencies and states base on **[Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/)**.
- Providing **[Event Driven Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/)** to manage your apps lifecycles.

### Why Robusta?

With traditional flutter app creation, it is inevitably to add more packages and to handle the configuration complexity that associated with those packages.

However with **Robusta**, it accelerates the process of adding and configurating packages with one line command only.
